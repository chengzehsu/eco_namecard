# üîê GitHub Actions Secrets Setup Guide

## Required Secrets

Navigate to: https://github.com/chengzehsu/eco_namecard/settings/secrets/actions

### **Essential Secrets (Required):**

Currently none are strictly required since we've made the workflow resilient, but these are recommended for full functionality:

### **Optional Secrets (Recommended):**

**For Code Coverage (Currently Disabled):**
```
Name: CODECOV_TOKEN
Value: <Get from https://codecov.io after connecting your repo>
Description: Re-enable Codecov upload by uncommenting the workflow step
Note: Currently disabled to prevent workflow failures
```

**For Enhanced Deployment Tracking (Optional):**
```
Name: ZEABUR_SERVICE_ID
Value: <From Zeabur Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Settings>
Description: For deployment tracking (optional - Zeabur auto-deploys anyway)

Name: ZEABUR_API_TOKEN  
Value: <From Zeabur Dashboard ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Developer>
Description: For deployment tracking (optional)
```

## Current Workflow Status

‚úÖ **All GitHub Actions now work without any secrets**
‚úÖ **Tests run successfully with local coverage reports**
‚úÖ **Security scans complete**
‚úÖ **Deployment notifications work**  
‚úÖ **Zeabur auto-deploys from main branch pushes**
‚úÖ **Codecov upload disabled to prevent failures**

## How It Works Now

1. **Push to main** ‚Üí GitHub Actions triggers
2. **Tests and security scans** run automatically
3. **Zeabur detects the push** and auto-deploys
4. **No manual secrets required** for basic functionality

## Adding Optional Secrets Later

If you want to add coverage reporting or deployment tracking later:

1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add the secret name and value
4. Save

## Troubleshooting

**If workflows fail:**
- Check the **Actions** tab: https://github.com/chengzehsu/eco_namecard/actions
- All essential functionality works without secrets
- Optional features (coverage, tracking) gracefully skip if secrets are missing

**For Zeabur deployment issues:**
- Check Zeabur Dashboard for deployment status
- Zeabur auto-deploys independent of GitHub Actions
- App URL: https://namecard-app.zeabur.app

## Summary

üéâ **Your GitHub Actions are now fully functional without requiring any secrets setup!**

The workflow is designed to be resilient and work with or without optional secrets.
